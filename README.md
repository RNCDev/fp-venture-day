```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### 1. Installation
First, install the necessary Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Local Development
To make changes, use the watch script:
```bash
npm run watch
```
This command automatically rebuilds `index.html` every time you save a change to `content.md`. You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser to see your updates.

For a live-reloading server, run this command in a separate terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Making Changes

#### Content Changes
All content is managed in `content.md`. This file uses YAML frontmatter for metadata (like version and supporters) and Markdown for the session content. See the `Adding Content` section below for formatting details.

#### UI/Design Changes
**Important**: The approach depends on what you want to change:

- **CSS-only changes** (styling, colors, spacing): Edit `styles.css` directly - no build needed
- **HTML structure or JavaScript changes**: Edit `build.js` file, then run `npm run build`

The `styles.css` file is static and can be edited directly. The `script.js` file is generated by the build process, so any manual changes to it will be overwritten.

For UI modifications:
1. **CSS changes**: Edit `styles.css` directly
2. **HTML/JS changes**: Edit `build.js`, then run `npm run build`
3. Test your changes by opening `index.html` in a browser

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

When you're ready to publish your changes:

1.  **Stop the Watcher**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm run watch` is running.
2.  **Final Build**: It's good practice to run `npm run build` one last time manually to ensure you have the final version.
3.  **Commit and Push**: You **must** commit both the source file (`content.md`) and the generated output file (`index.html`) for your changes to appear on the live site.

    ```bash
    # Add both the content you changed and the resulting html file
    git add content.md index.html

    # Commit the changes
    git commit -m "Update speaker list for 2025"

    # Push to GitHub to deploy
    git push
    ```
GitHub Pages will automatically serve the updated content.

## 🤖 AI Assistant Workflow

When working with an AI assistant to modify this project, follow this workflow:

### After Content Changes
1. **Make changes** to `content.md` (speakers, sessions, supporters, etc.)
2. **Run build command**: `npm run build` to regenerate the website
3. **Review changes**: Open `index.html` to verify the updates
4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add content.md index.html
   git commit -m "Update content: [brief description of changes]"
   git push
   ```

### After UI/Design Changes
1. **Make changes** to the appropriate file(s):
   - **CSS-only changes**: Edit `styles.css` directly
   - **HTML structure/JavaScript changes**: Edit `build.js`
2. **Run build command**: `npm run build` to regenerate output files (if `build.js` was modified)
3. **Review changes**: Open `index.html` to verify the updates
4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   # For CSS-only changes:
   git add styles.css
   git commit -m "Update UI: [brief description of changes]"
   git push
   
   # For build.js changes:
   git add build.js index.html styles.css script.js
   git commit -m "Update UI: [brief description of changes]"
   git push
   ```

### AI Commit Message Guidelines
- Be specific about what was changed
- Include the type of change (content vs UI)
- Examples:
  - "Add 2025 speaker lineup and supporters"
  - "Update styling for mobile responsiveness"
  - "Fix supporter link formatting for 2024"

## 📝 Adding Content

#### New Year
1. Add year to YAML frontmatter in `content.md`:
   ```yaml
   years:
     2026:
       supporters:
         - name: "New Supporter"
           url: "https://example.com"
   ```

2. Add year section to Markdown:
   ```markdown
   ## 2026
   
   ### 9:00am – 9:30am
   **New Speaker**
   
   Speaker description...
   ```

#### New Sessions
Use consistent Markdown format:
```markdown
### 9:00am – 9:30am
**Speaker Name**

Speaker description or presentation details.
```

For lunch breaks:
```markdown
### 12:00pm – 1:00pm
**LUNCH**
```

#### New Supporters
Edit the `supporters` array in YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
years:
  2025:
    supporters:
      - name: "Company Name"
        url: "https://company-website.com"
```

## 🛠️ Build System

### Commands

- `npm run build` - Build the site once
- `npm run dev` - Build and serve locally
- `npm run watch` - Watch for changes and rebuild

### How It Works

1. **Parse YAML Frontmatter** - Extract version, supporters, and year metadata
2. **Parse Markdown Content** - Convert sessions and speaker information to structured data
3. **Generate HTML** - Create responsive HTML with collapsible year sections
4. **Output Files** - Write `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`

### Key Features

- **Automatic supporter links** - Generated from YAML frontmatter per year
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-friendly collapsible interface
- **Version management** - Automatic version display in header
- **Session parsing** - Handles regular sessions and lunch breaks
- **Clean separation** - CSS and JS in external files

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Build System**: Custom Node.js with js-yaml
- **Framework**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Cache Control**: Optimized headers to prevent caching issues
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design with mobile optimization
- **Performance**: Minimal dependencies, fast loading

## 📱 Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- Git and GitHub repository access

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rncdev/fp-venture-day.git
cd fp-venture-day

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the site
npm run build

# Serve locally
npm run dev
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Build Issues**: Check YAML syntax in frontmatter and Markdown formatting
- **Deployment Issues**: Check your local build and ensure `index.html` is committed.
- **Content Issues**: Validate supporter URLs and speaker name formatting
