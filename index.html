                        <p>Vellum Biosciences, an UPSTART spin-out from the University of Pennsylvania, has developed iTAG, a patent-protected imaging probe that provides a GPS-like tracking and monitoring of vectors used to deliver cell and gene therapies. These vectors, such as T cells, NK cells and AAVs, which we refer to as "living drug", are unlike traditional biologics in that they expand, contract and persist in various tissues in ways that cannot be comprehensively measured over time by traditional methods. Vellum's iTAG has integrated with virtually any living drug to characterize its cellular trafficking over time using PET imaging, which allows for a non-invasive, whole-body window by which researchers and clinicians can monitor, measure, and ultimately modify cell and gene therapies. Optimizing and characterizing these living drugs before entering the clinic can improve the probability of success of these clinical candidates.</p>

                        <h2>Mark Yarmarkovich</h2>
                        <p>Dr. Yarmarkovich's research has enabled the discovery and immunotherapeutic targeting of intracellular cancer drivers through the use of peptide-centric chimeric antigen receptors (PC-CARs). PC-CARs were developed using a counter panning strategy with predicted potentially cross-reactive peptides to target unmutated peptide derived from the essential oncoprotein PHOX2B. Furthermore, informed by immunopeptidomics, they showed that PHOX2B PC-CARs also recognize PHOX2B presented by other HLA types, breaking conventional HLA restriction and significantly expanding the addressable patient population. Finally, they demonstrated potent and specific killing of neuroblastoma cells expressing these HLA-A2 and complete tumor regression in mice.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Ping Wang is a Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and Founder of Instanosis. Dr Wang and her team have developed a point-of-care diagnostic device for femtomolar biomarker detection and quantitation, using novel and robust sensors, computer vision and smartphone imaging. Clinical data demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity, and competitive advantages over existing diagnostic technologies. The device has broad applicability wherever high sensitivity biomarker measurement is needed. A robust pipeline has been developed including pathogen detection, cancer, neurology and cardiovascular biomarkers.</p>

He gave a presentation on how Hysplex came to focus on developing new forms of PARP1 that take advantage of the Hysplex team's breakthroughs in understanding how to use them to tune the balance between their target, PARP-1, and DNA. This tuning permits Hysplex to generate DNA pro-trapping PARP1 designed to kill tumor cells in specific cancer patients, as well as DNA anti-trapping PARP1 that are designed to restrain hyperactive PARP-1 in Parkinson's disease and preserve neurons.</p>
