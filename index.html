These vectors, such as T cells, NK cells and AAVs, which we refer to as "living drug", are unlike traditional biologics in that they expand, contract and persist in various tissues in ways that cannot be comprehensively measured over time by traditional methods. Vellum's iTAG has integrated with virtually any living drug to characterize its cellular trafficking over time using PET imaging, which allows for a non-invasive, whole-body window by which researchers and clinicians can monitor, measure, and ultimately modify cell and gene therapies. Optimizing and characterizing these living drugs before entering the clinic can improve the probability of success of these clinical candidates.</p>

PC-CARs were developed using a counter panning strategy with predicted potentially cross-reactive peptides to target unmutated peptide derived from the essential oncoprotein PHOX2B. Furthermore, informed by immunopeptidomics, they showed that PHOX2B PC-CARs also recognize PHOX2B presented by other HLA types, breaking conventional HLA restriction and significantly expanding the addressable patient population. Finally, they demonstrated potent and specific killing of neuroblastoma cells expressing these HLA-A2 and complete tumor regression in mice.</p>
