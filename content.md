## 2023

### 9:15am – 9:45am
**Mark Sellmyer, Derek Miller**

Vellum Biosciences, an UPSTART spin-out from the University of Pennsylvania, has developed iTAG, a patent-protected imaging probe that provides a GPS-like tracking and monitoring of vectors used to deliver cell and gene therapies. These vectors, such as T cells, NK cells and AAVs, which we refer to as "living drug", are unlike traditional biologics in that they expand, contract and persist in various tissues in ways that cannot be comprehensively measured over time by traditional methods. Vellum's iTAG has integrated with virtually any living drug to characterize its cellular trafficking over time using PET imaging, which allows for a non-invasive, whole-body window by which researchers and clinicians can monitor, measure, and ultimately modify cell and gene therapies. Optimizing and characterizing these living drugs before entering the clinic can improve the probability of success of these clinical candidates.
